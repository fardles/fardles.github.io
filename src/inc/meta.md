This site was built largely with the wiki engine developed by [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html), with additional code from [tehn](https://nnnnnnnn.co). Heavily inspired by [XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html) as well.

Pages are written in Markdown in iA Writer or Sublime Text. The site is then built using a combination of `cmark`, `bash`, and `C`. 

Images are re-sized using `convert` (imagemagick).
