Session with:

- {Norns}
	- twine (granulator)
	- {subsets}
- Field recordings ('field' meaning the bathroom -- there was a most amazing sound when the water was emptying from O's bathtub)

Thinking about: (a) how to combine sounds & music; (b) what is the significance of discovering sounds within sounds; (c) how to listen, how to perform, how to listen when not performing.
