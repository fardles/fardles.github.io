<p>These are the thoughts and scribblings of a rambler, a dabbler, a noise-maker, a brick-layer.</p>
<p>In many ways, I've always had an abstract fascination with music. Abstract because my own dilettantism had led me far from being able to read music or play an instrument. I was struck many times by the desire to &quot;do music&quot;, but without the skills to do so in a traditional manner, I was stuck.</p>
<p>A number of breakthroughs helped me along:</p>
<ol>
<li>the discovery of musicians like Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Cage in my teenage years;</li>
<li>the re-discovery of electronic music and monome in my late 20s (<em>ie</em>, the present); and</li>
<li>the resolution that professionalism and virtuosity (while necessary and good) should not be a bar to experimentation, dabbling and (what might otherwise be called) folly.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many ways, I've now come back full circle to the heady teenage years of just having fun and messing with things, without any real plan. This is a freeing prospect. I need to remind myself constantly that there are some things that are worth doing in and of themselves. Music is very well one of them.</p>
<p>Some of my music comes out as {Shallow Fords}.</p>
