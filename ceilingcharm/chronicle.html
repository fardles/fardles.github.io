<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The adventurers found themselves in the town of Ceilingcharm, sitting on the intersection between two major trade routes. As they walked through the town, an explosion ripped through the prison and sent townspeople fleeing for their lives. The heroes rushed towards the source of the sound and encountered three <b>zombies</b> attacking some of the townsfolk. With a flourish, Visenya turned into a horse and Raf launched Stumblecluck onto Visenya’s back. With ease, they despatch the three <b>zombies</b>. They noticed that the zombies had holes in their bodies, three on either side arranged symmetrically. Visenya kept one of the zombie’s heads.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They made their way to the prison, where they encountered the nervous <b>Lieutenant Somerville</b> who offers to bring them to the <b>Mayor</b> for work. After trying to convince <b>Lieutenant Somerville</b> that his conscience was speaking to him, the adventurers, refusing to be told what to do, extracted some payment from <b>Lieutenant Somerville</b> and only then allowed him to bring them to the <b>Mayor</b>, on their own terms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the Mayor’s house, the most ornately decorated in the town square, they are ushered into the sitting room by <b>Manslow</b>, a gnome manservant. While waiting in the sitting room, Stumblecluck and Raf inspected the room. Raf discovered a symbol approximating a skull etched into the wall of the room. The Mayor, <b>Mayor Ulrich</b>, then stepped into the room with a skinny man clad in black, who is later introduced as <b>Master Ryland</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Mayor Ulrich</b> offers the adventurers 50 gold pieces for each bandit captured “alive or otherwise” and 200 gold pieces for the bandit leader – he tells the adventurers that the bandits in the abandoned mine were likely behind the attack on the prison and that the zombies were raised from the same arcane magic that destroyed part of the prison building. He seemed truly to believe what he was saying. Upon questioning, the Mayor revealed that he had come to Ceilingcharm about a year and a half ago, and was elected around a year ago. The adventurers accepted <b>Mayor Ulrich’s</b> proposal, and <b>Mayor Ulrich</b> issues them a <i>mayorial writ</i> which would grant them authority to pursue the investigation. When he leaves, the adventurers speak to the haughty <b>Master Ryland</b> who sheds more light on the possibility of a necromancer who has taken up residence nearby. Raf confronted <b>Master Ryland</b> with the symbol, and a flicker of recognition was seen on his face.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As they were leaving, <b>Manslow</b> recommended <i>The Dancing Boar</i> tavern, just across the town square, for the night. There, the adventurers met the innkeeper, <b>Libby</b> a tall and hefty woman with noticeable scars on her face – she tells them that <b>Master Ryland</b> had first arrived at Ceilingcharm about a year ago, and that they had a good life in the town. Visenya manages to trick <b>Libby</b> into thinking that the mayorial writ covered all their expenses, and <b>Libby</b> gives them the best rooms for the night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next morning, they speak to the barkeep, a rough hairy man shorter than <b>Libby</b>, seeking information about the bandits. They noticed that he had a tatoo of a dagger surrounded by flames on his left bicep. The man directs them to the barracks where they can get more information about the bandits. They proceed there and after Raf entrances some of the guards with a card trick (assisted by Visenya), <b>Sergeant Willi</b> helpfully gives them details about the bandit’s hideout and a rough map to the abandoned mine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When they probed him further and showed him the symbol, <b>Sergeant Willi</b> divulged that they had seen that symbol in the houses of families that had disappeared. The disappearances had started about a year ago and happened a few months’ apart. Borrowing some broken armour and rags from <b>Sergeant Willi</b>, Raf and Stumbecluck disguised themselves as bandits. Visenya received a <i>chanfron</i> (a horse’s face armour).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They made their way through the forest to the north of Ceilingcharm. After a few hours of trekking, the adventurers found themselves at the edge of a clearing. Stealthed, they could see a circle of wagons, and children playing. Raf managed to sneak his way across the open space to a wagon and as he climbed into a wagon, was seen by a woman inside, who shouted to alarm the rest.</span></p>
