<h2 id="session-01">Session 01</h2>
<p><span id="char">The adventurers</span> found themselves in the town of <span id="place">Ceilingcharm</span>, sitting on the intersection between two major trade routes. As they walked through the town, an explosion ripped through the local <span id="place">prison</span> and sent townspeople fleeing for their lives. The heroes rushed towards the source of the sound and despatched three <strong>zombies</strong> attacking some of the townsfolk on the way. On inspecting the bodies, they noticed that the zombies had holes in their bodies, three on either side arranged symmetrically.</p>
<p>They made their way to <span id="place">the prison</span>, where they encountered the nervous <strong>Lieutenant Somerville</strong> who offered to bring them to the <strong>Mayor</strong> for work. After extracting payment from <strong>Lieutenant Somerville</strong>, the adventurers allowed him to bring them to the <strong>Mayor</strong>.</p>
<p>At <span id="place">the Mayor’s house</span>, the most ornately decorated in the town square, they were ushered into the sitting room by <strong>Manslow</strong>, a gnome manservant. While waiting in the sitting room, <span id="char">Rafe</span> discovered a symbol approximating a skull etched into the wall of the room. The Mayor, <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong>, then stepped into the room with a skinny man clad in black, who was later introduced as <strong>Master Ryland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong> offered the adventurers 50 gold pieces for each bandit captured “alive or otherwise” and 200 gold pieces for the bandit leader – he tells the adventurers that the bandits in <span id="place">the abandoned mine</span> were likely behind the attack on the prison and that the zombies were raised from the same arcane magic that destroyed part of the prison building. The adventurers accepted <strong>Mayor Ulrich’s</strong> proposal, and <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong> issued them a <span id="item"><em>mayorial writ</em></span> which would grant them authority to pursue the investigation. When he left, the adventurers spoke to the haughty <strong>Master Ryland</strong> who shed more light on the possibility of a necromancer who has taken up residence nearby. Rafe confronted <strong>Master Ryland</strong> with the symbol, and a flicker of recognition was seen on his face.</p>
<p>As they were leaving, <strong>Manslow</strong> recommended <span id="place"><em>The Dancing Boar</em> tavern</span>, just across the town square, for the night. There, the adventurers met the innkeeper, <strong>Libby</strong> a tall and hefty woman with noticeable scars on her face – she tells them that <strong>Master Ryland</strong> had first arrived at Ceilingcharm about a year ago, and that they had a good life in the town. <span id="char">Visenya</span> managed to trick <strong>Libby</strong> into thinking that the mayorial writ covered all their expenses, and <strong>Libby</strong> gave them the best rooms for the night.</p>
<p>The next morning, they spoke to the barkeep, a rough hairy man shorter than <strong>Libby</strong>, seeking information about the bandits. <span id="char">Rafe</span> noticed that he had a tatoo of a dagger surrounded by flames on his left bicep. After evading their questioning, the man directed them to <span id="place">the barracks</span> where they could get more information about the bandits. They proceeded there and after <span id="char">Rafe</span> entranced some of the guards with a card trick (assisted by <span id="char">Visenya</span>), <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong> helpfully gave them details about the bandit’s hideout and a rough map to <span id="place">the abandoned mine</span>.</p>
<p>When they probed him further and showed him the symbol that they had found in <span id="place">the Mayor’s house</span>, <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong> divulged that they had seen that same symbol in the houses of families that had disappeared. The disappearances had started about a year ago and happened a few months’ apart. Borrowing some broken armour and rags from <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong>, <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumbecluck</span> disguised themselves as bandits. <span id="char">Visenya</span> received a <span id="item"><em>chanfron</em></span> (a horse’s face armour).</p>
<p>They made their way through the forest to the north of Ceilingcharm. After a few hours of trekking, the adventurers found themselves at the edge of a clearing. Stealthed, they could see a circle of wagons, and children playing. Rafe managed to sneak his way across the open space to a wagon and as he climbed into a wagon, was seen by a woman inside, who shouted to alarm the rest.</p>
