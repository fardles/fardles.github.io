  Stumblecluck, Rafe, and Visenya begin their adventures in Ceilingcharm when an explosion tears open the prison. They fight zombies.
  </span>

  <span id="char">The adventurers</span> found themselves in the town of <span id="place">Ceilingcharm</span>, sitting on the intersection between two major trade routes. As they walked through the town, an explosion ripped through the local <span id="place">prison</span> and sent townspeople fleeing for their lives. The heroes rushed towards the source of the sound and despatched three <strong>zombies</strong> attacking some of the townsfolk on the way. On inspecting the bodies, they noticed that the zombies had holes in their bodies, three on either side arranged symmetrically.

</p>

<p>They made their way to <span id="place">the prison</span>, where they encountered the nervous <strong>Lieutenant Somerville</strong> who offered to bring them to the <strong>Mayor</strong> for work. After extracting payment from <strong>Lieutenant Somerville</strong>, the adventurers allowed him to bring them to the <strong>Mayor</strong>.</p>

  The adventurers strike a deal with the Mayor and meet Master Ryland.
  </span>


  At <span id="place">the Mayor’s house</span>, the most ornately decorated in the town square, they were ushered into the sitting room by <strong>Manslow</strong>, a gnome manservant. While waiting in the sitting room, <span id="char">Rafe</span> discovered a symbol approximating a skull etched into the wall of the room. The Mayor, <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong>, then stepped into the room with a skinny man clad in black, who was later introduced as <strong>Master Ryland</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong> offered the adventurers 50 gold pieces for each bandit captured “alive or otherwise” and 200 gold pieces for the bandit leader – he tells the adventurers that the bandits in <span id="place">the abandoned mine</span> were likely behind the attack on the prison and that the zombies were raised from the same arcane magic that destroyed part of the prison building. The adventurers accepted <strong>Mayor Ulrich’s</strong> proposal, and <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong> issued them a <span id="item"><em>mayorial writ</em></span> which would grant them authority to pursue the investigation. When he left, the adventurers spoke to the haughty <strong>Master Ryland</strong> who shed more light on the possibility of a necromancer who has taken up residence nearby. Rafe confronted <strong>Master Ryland</strong> with the symbol, and a flicker of recognition was seen on his face.</p>

<p>As they were leaving, <strong>Manslow</strong> recommended <span id="place"><em>The Dancing Boar</em> tavern</span>, just across the town square, for the night. There, the adventurers met the innkeeper, <strong>Libby</strong> a tall and hefty woman with noticeable scars on her face – she tells them that <strong>Master Ryland</strong> had first arrived at Ceilingcharm about a year ago, and that they had a good life in the town. <span id="char">Visenya</span> managed to trick <strong>Libby</strong> into thinking that the mayorial writ covered all their expenses, and <strong>Libby</strong> gave them the best rooms for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning, they spoke to the barkeep, a rough hairy man shorter than <strong>Libby</strong>, seeking information about the bandits. <span id="char">Rafe</span> noticed that he had a tatoo of a dagger surrounded by flames on his left bicep. After evading their questioning, the man directed them to <span id="place">the barracks</span> where they could get more information about the bandits.

  The adventurers go to the barracks to receive more information.

  They proceeded there and after <span id="char">Rafe</span> entranced some of the guards with a card trick (assisted by <span id="char">Visenya</span>), <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong> helpfully gave them details about the bandit’s hideout and a rough map to <span id="place">the abandoned mine</span>.</p>

<p>When they probed him further and showed him the symbol that they had found in <span id="place">the Mayor’s house</span>, <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong> divulged that they had seen that same symbol in the houses of families that had disappeared. The disappearances had started about a year ago and happened a few months’ apart. Borrowing some broken armour and rags from <strong>Sergeant Willi</strong>, <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumbecluck</span> disguised themselves as bandits. <span id="char">Visenya</span> received a <span id="item"><em>chanfron</em></span> (a horse’s face armour).</p>

  The adventurers proceed to the abandoned mine, where their sneaking meets with a mishap.
  </span>


  They made their way through the forest to the north of Ceilingcharm. After a few hours of trekking, the adventurers found themselves at the edge of a clearing. Stealthed, they could see a circle of wagons, and children playing. <span id="char">Rafe</span> managed to sneak his way across the open space to a wagon and as he climbed into a wagon, was seen by a woman inside, who shouted to alarm the rest.</p>

<h2 id="session-02">Session 02</h2>

<p>At the clearing, <span id="char">Rafe</span> was quickly surrounded by a group of men. Trying to deceive the men, he only managed to confuse them, and at that point, a light burst out from the side and there stood a figure in white and gold chain mail, a mace and a shield like a crystal, <span id="char">Starlight</span>. <span id="char">Visenya</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> continued their ruse as they approached the standoff, with Stumblecluck claimed that he wanted to sell the elf to the bandits. The confusion mounting, <span id="char">Rafe</span>, <span id="char">Visenya</span>, and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> and escorted to the centre of the wagons, where they meet <strong>Isaak</strong>, the leader of the bandits.</p>

<p>When the adventurers mentioned the explosion in town, <strong>Isaak</strong> invited them down to the cavern in <span id="place">the abandoned mine</span>. Surrounded by <span id="char">Starlight</span> and some of the bandits, the three adventurers try to convince <strong>Isaak</strong> that they were “entrepreneurs” who were hoping to sell the elf to the bandits. Horrified, <strong>Isaak</strong> quickly released <span id="char">Visenya</span>. <span id="char">Rafe</span> let slip that they were helping the mayor figure out what had happened in the explosion, and, upon showing <strong>Isaak</strong> the symbol carved into the houses where people had gone missing, <strong>Isaak</strong> revealed the truth behind what the bandits were doing. The women and children, he said, had been chased out of town after the men of the households were forcibly removed from their houses at night, and some of them reported seeing the armour of the town guard worn by those men. They also reported seeing that symbol at around the time of those kidnappings.</p>

<p>Won over by a display of <span id="char">Starlight’s</span> holy symbol, as well as the realisation that the bandits were doing good, <span id="char">the three adventurers</span> decided to help the bandits. <strong>Isaak</strong> proposed that they go into Ceilingcharm to find out what was happening. They concocted a plan to pretend that <span id="char">Starlight</span> was the bandit leader and to present her to <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong>. They disguised <span id="char">Starlight</span> and brought her back to Ceilingcharm, tying her hands with a rope at the outskirts of the town. <span id="char">Visenya</span> took the form of a mouse and hid in <span id="char">Starlight’s</span> cloak.</p>
<p><span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> began a procession into town, with <span id="char">Starlight</span> making a huge ruckus. They proceeded to <span id="place">the Mayor’s House</span> where they were put in the sitting room again. <strong>Mayor Ulrich</strong> was pleased with the result and was convinced that <span id="char">Starlight</span> was in fact the bandit leader. He rewarded <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> with <span id="item">a chit for 200GP</span>.</p>

<p><span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> exited and camped outside <span id="place">the Mayor’s House</span>, successfully hiding in some bushes out back. After a time, guards took <span id="char">Starlight</span> out of the house and to <span id="place">the prison</span>, where she was locked in one of the cells in the basement. <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> stealthily followed and hid themselves in an alley across from the prison. In her cell, <span id="char">Starlight</span> started to shout and chant, and not before long, the two other prisoners began to join in, and the chaos that ensued caused all the guards in the area to rush downstairs, seemingly fearful of the consequences if the chaos was not controlled. Upon trying to be gagged, <span id="char">Starlight</span> bit at the hands of her captors in a fit of fury and indignation, and they failed to gag her again.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this commotion, <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> rushed in as well, only to see a brown mouse try to steal the keys from one of the guards. <span id="char">Rafe</span> tried to do so as well, but the guard felt the tugging on the keys, but, with a comforting smile and trustworthy eyes, managed to convince the guard that he was trying to help.</p>

<p>When things were quieting down, the other guards left and returned to outside the prison, standing watch over the hole that the explosion had left in the walls. <span id="char">Rafe</span> and <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> returned to their hiding spot in the alleyway, while <span id="char">Visenya</span> scampered into the neighbouring cell and returned to her elven form. Soon, a figure in a black robe entered the prison, and went to <span id="char">Starlight’s</span> cell. <strong>Master Ryland</strong> introduced himself, and two guards took <span id="char">Starlight</span> and began dragging her along behind <strong>Master Ryland</strong>. Ever the man of affairs, <strong>Master Ryland</strong> went on before the guards, who were struggling with <span id="char">Starlight</span>. <span id="char">Visenya</span> wild-shaped again into a mouse and followed after <span id="char">Starlight</span>, managing to cling onto one of the guards’ boots.</p>

<p>With a startling good performance, pretending to be in pain <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> managed to convince one of the guards to come to him. As he did so, however, <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> swung his battle axe at the guard. <span id="char">Visenya</span>, trying to tickle one of the guards in her mouse form, was hit and exploded out of the guard's trousers. The now four adventurers quickly knocked the guards out, in the sight of all the townspeople who lived along that road. Quickly, they managed to track <strong>Master Ryland’s</strong> footprints, which led them out of the town, and to a clearing in the forest, hidden from the road and the town by trees.</p>

<p>Investigating, <span id="char">Rafe</span> discovered an elevated circle, and with a burst of strength, <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> managed to lift the circle and push it open. The adventurers then descended the staircase and found themselves in <span id="place">a tunnel of roughly hewn stone</span>. Checking for traps, they managed to disarm one glyph, before the next one activated in response to <span id="char">Visenya’s</span> tampering. As they proceeded further, they began hearing the clanging of iron chains, and, with his experience with stonework, <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> surmised that the stones at the end of the tunnel were older and smoother than the stones were where they had entered from.</p>

<p>They emerged from the tunnel into a room, containing iron chains moving from the ceiling and a table with various sharp implements, each caked with blood. The iron chains appeared to be moved by gears, with the whole system extending into the walls. Upon entering the room, <span id="char">Rafe</span> triggered a glyph and was almost consumed by acid which spurted out from the tile below him. As they examined the room, <span id="char">Stumblecluck</span> and <span id="char">Starlight</span> heard a scream from ahead.</p>

<p>Moving out of room, beyond a door, they entered into another corridor. They inched towards the end of the corridor, where they saw that it led into a large atrium, supported by four pillars on two sides, and a group of robed figures in the middle of the atrium, facing a podium at the end. There, elevated, was <strong>Master Ryland</strong>, standing over a naked figure. Tubes ran from the walls and spurted out a green liquid near the podium periodically. With a knife in one hand, and a tube in the other, <strong>Master Ryland</strong> stabbed the figure and plunged the tube into its side.</p>
