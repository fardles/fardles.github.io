    <dd>- While in combat with <b>Laphroaig</b>, <b>Johnni</b> and <b>Fara</b> (through his steed) experienced the final moments of some victims of Oradour - one of whom was slain by a halberd.</dd>
    <dd>- After <b>Laphroaig's</b> defeat, it was revealed that Kushanite raiders burnt the village down to grow <b>Laphroaig's</b> power through the suffering experienced by the villagers. <b>Laphroaig</b> revealed that the shaman <b>Tosim</b> holds a totem which compels his service, and tasks the party to destroy it.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Laphroaig</b> revealed that plans are underway to bring about <i>Karakorum</i> in the city of Ordos, which will take place within a few days. It also revealed that Kushan agents were already in the city.</dd>
    <li>The party returned to Ordos, where the summer festival is underway, seeking to find these agents and prevent the impending calamity.</li>
    <dd>- The party warns both <b>Ambassador Ishar</b> as well as <b>Sergeant Moghe</b> about possible infiltration, stepping up security in the Temple, Market, and Refugee districts.</dd>
    <dd>- The party enlisteed the help of <b>Safavid</b> in finding out more about <i>Karakorum</i>. <b>Safavid</b> also explained that a once a century astrological event (taking place tomorrow) seems to coincide with this.</dd>
    <dd>- The party also discovered a cache of tempered Alchemist's Fire (dubbed 'Wildfire' by <b>Johnni</b> and <b>Melissandre</b> within the stores of the Elven Embassy. <b>Ishar</b> explains that they were a 'political gift'.</dd>
