  <h4 style="color:#00539C">11 July | Rudy's Farm, Taklamakan Desert</h4>
  <h4>Major Updates</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Party spoke to Rudy, and came to an arrangement to provide water to the city of Ordos, so long as her granddaughter Saoirse is taken care of.</li>
    <li>Party also learnt about the ants of the farm being stressed and agitated, and investigated the cause with Saoirse. The party discovered the source to be nesting <i>Ankhegs</i>.
    </li>
    <dd>- The party dispatched both <i>Ankhegs</i>, neutralising the threat to Rudy's Farm. They also discovered a corpse bearing an <i>Amulet with three circles</i> (kept by <b>Gimmo</b>.)</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Vinidad</b> acquired some acid glands that might be useful in crafting poisons.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Gimmo</b>,<b>Johnni</b>, and <b>Vinidad</b> decided to keep an <i>Ankheg egg</i> each, while Rudy kept two for her farm.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Gimmo</b> scouted the burrows from which the <i>Ankhegs</i> emerged, finding them to lead south beneath the Taklamankan desert. However, parts of the tunnel were submerged preventing further exploration.</dd>
    <li>Party also met a reclusive Dwarf, Ying, whom the party suspect came from the borderlands near Orochi.</li>
    <dd>- <b>Vinidad</b> asked <b>Melissandre</b> about a Dwarven inscription, which read "Lieutenant".</dd>
    <dd>- Ying revealed that Kushan forces were amassing near Orochi, and is fearful this might be the beginning of a new Kushan horde. He also asked the party to warn the Dwarven military of the threat.</dd>
    <li>Party then continued south into the Taklamakan Desert, escourting Tenzing's crew. During the first night, an elephant skull was discovered, which <b>Vinidad</b> and <b>Gimmo</b> remembered was linked to fables about the Khan's lost Tomb.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h4>Character Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Vinidad</b> made an offer to recruit Ying into the organisation. Ying was convinced to think it over at Rudy's Farm.
<li><b>Gimmo</b> discovered that subterranean sources of water might be found around the outskirts of the Tarim Basin.
</ul>
<h4>Rumours/Leads</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The party learnt from Ying that Kushan raiding squads usually operate in groups of six.</li>
