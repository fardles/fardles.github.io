<h4 id="22/08" style="color:#00539C">22 August | Oradour, Ordos</h4>
<h4>Major Updates</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>The party explored the burnt out village of Oradour, encountering the black kami known as <b>Laphroaig</b> and uncovering the truth of what took place there.</li>
    <dd>- While in combat with <b>Laphroaig</b>, <b>Johnni</b> and <b>Fara</b> (through his steed) experienced the final moments of some victims of Oradour - one of whom was slain by a halberd.</dd>
    <dd>- After <b>Laphroaig's</b> defeat, it was revealed that Kushanite raiders burnt the village down to grow <b>Laphroaig's</b> power through the suffering experienced by the villagers. <b>Laphroaig</b> revealed that the shaman <b>Tosim</b> holds a totem which compels his service, and tasks the party to destroy it.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Laphroaig</b> revealed that plans are underway to bring about <i>Karakorum</i> in the city of Ordos, which will take place within a few days. It also revealed that Kushan agents were already in the city.</dd>
    <li>The party returned to Ordos, where the summer festival is underway, seeking to find these agents and prevent the impending calamity.</li>
    <dd>- The party warns both <b>Ambassador Ishar</b> as well as <b>Sergeant Moghe</b> about possible infiltration, stepping up security in the Temple, Market, and Refugee districts.</dd>
    <dd>- The party enlisteed the help of <b>Safavid</b> in finding out more about <i>Karakorum</i>. <b>Safavid</b> also explained that a once a century astrological event (taking place tomorrow) seems to coincide with this.</dd>
    <dd>- The party also discovered a cache of tempered Alchemist's Fire (dubbed 'Wildfire' by <b>Johnni</b> and <b>Melissandre</b> within the stores of the Elven Embassy. <b>Ishar</b> explains that they were a 'political gift'.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Vinidad</b> spoke to <b>Borthe</b> the Teahouse Owner enquiring about suspicious individuals staying in the Teahouse. She seemed worried about something, and asked the party to come to her again in the evening.</dd>

</ul>

<h4>Character Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Vinidad</b> was on his way to look for <b>Minji</b> when she came rushing to him, desperate for his help.
<li><b>Melissandre</b> and <b>Fara</b> managed to convince the city guard to cancel their holiday and step up security during the festival.</li>
<li>Upon meditating on his experiences in the desert, <b>Johnni</b> has developed a way to weaponise the deprivation of water, mastering the ability to use his Ki to <i>Dessicate</i> enemies.</li>
<li><b>Fara</b> has also taken up another sackcloth doll from the ruins of Oradour, in addition to his current doll.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rumours/Leads</h4>
<ul><li><b>The House of Dancing Water</b> is in town, bringing with it a massive carnival. It is currently set up in the Temple District and the adjoining Eastern Market.</li>
<li>Through experimentation, the party discovered that "Wildfire" is not easily put out by water, but have found that starving the fire of oxygen does the trick. The party suspects the same substance may have been used in Oradour. The city guard have been notified to prepare sandbags.</ul>
