<h4>Major Updates</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>The party assisted Sergeant Moghe in improving the defence of Ordos, now that her garrisons have departed for Orochi. The party bolstered the existing troops, while putting together a citizen's militia.</li>
    <dd>- <b>Vinidad</b> enlisted the help of Orichenko to have less savoury characters assist in Ordos' defence.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Fara</b> applied his military background to train the troops to be prepared for conflict, bolstering them with a rousing speech.</dd>
    <dd>- <b>Johnni</b> provided the troops with a martial arts demonstration, as well as a rather moving (albeit unexpected) bagpipe performance.</dd>
    <li>The party found out from Safavid that Havir has made headway in researching the shrine at Annapurna, but was late in checking in. The party agreed to visit the shrine - also to cure the curse that inflicted <b>Vinidad</b>.</li>
    <dd>- The party learnt a ritual from Havir involving blue lotus root incense, curing <b>Vinidad</b> of the curse.</dd>
    <dd>- The party encountered an enigmatic figure called Kiki Tiki, who offered the party 'truth' if they overcame three trials of Hatred, Greed, and Ignorance.</dd>
    <dd>- The party underwent the trial of Ignorance, all accepting Kiki Tiki's offers.</dd>
    <li>Juhani is setting off for the Sherpa Village, journeying together with the party.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Character Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Vinidad</b> had a busy few days, setting up a firearms deal with his contact <i>The Merchant</i> and the boss Orichenko. He also then brought Lieutenant Ying into Ordos, under the employ of Orichenko to provide information. <b>Vinidad</b> also accepted Kiki Tiki's bargain to not form personal attachments, in order to protect himself from the pernicious world (reroll any die once per day).</li>
<li><b>Melissandre</b> gave Safavid her thesis - a response to the Sultan's <i>Arcana in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>, which Safavid feels will lead to an official invitation to the Madrasah of Samarkand. <b>Melissandre</b> also accepted Kiki Tiki's bargain, forming a pact with the cosmic powers of beyond for power. (Multiclass warlock with INT as spellcasting attribute, and one additional Invocation).</li>
<li><b>Johnni</b> too accepted a bargain with Kiki Tiki to further his mastery of the elements, giving up his memory of his past motivations for mastering the elements in the first place. Free of such burdensome obligations, he has taken the first step to understanding the void that is the <i>Kai</i> (expended Ki points become Kai points - while at least 1 Kai point is available, Johnni adds his WIS bonus to Attack rolls.)</li>
<li><b>Fara</b> took on an Oath to Kiki Tiki, to serve as guardian not only of the good of the Elves or Dwarves, but for the good of the entire realm, and the natural order. To carry out this oath, <b>Fara</b> was given the <i>Mirror Shield</i>, companion to the <i>Iron Halo</i> (granting its bearer the ability to deflect rays and gaze attacks, as well as an aura of competence granting his CHA bonus to skill checks of allies within 10 feet).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rumours/Leads</h4>
<ul><li>The party learnt from <i>The Merchant</i> that the Dwarven Dynasty may not be as committed to the defence of Orochi as initially thought, and that the leader of the Kushan forces deliberately chose Orochi for this reason.</li>
<li>Party learnt from Safavid that a popular troupe <i>The House of Dancing Water</i> might arrive in Ordos in a few days, refugees from Orochi.</li>
<li>Party learnt from Safavid too that the armaments given to a Western Hero by the gods consisted of a halo, a shield, as well as a flaming sword.</li>
