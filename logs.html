  	This is where he scribbles, in no small measure compelled by the absence of anything else to do, not busy enough to forget himself, not free enough to be, simply, as he ought to be. But scribble he will, and scribble he shall, logs of walking back and forth, and up and down, and then ending up nowhere, but with a headache and sore eyes, slightly embarassed and pink.

      As the crow flies &mdash;</br>
      How do we know how</br>
      the crow flies &mdash; lines are not </br>
      straight, neither for us nor for them. </br>
      Bird paths, lives, cross over roads </br>
      and paths and intersect, </br>
      cut, weave, cover, rend, </br>
      above our concrete nests. </br>

  	Too much caught up in miniscule concerns and config files. But more than that, the temptation to buy and buy. Beautiful objects to be sure, but in their beauty, their captivating, enthralling beauty, also a trap and a snare. Why, as a mere consumer who can get by with much less, do I yearn for the "professional"? It's part of the charm, the workflows that will never flow, the imaginations and machinations of thing-lust and object-yearning-so. Be satisfied, says he who gives all, be satisfied for the world is yours. He says, I know, but yet the fingers scroll.</p>

		  <p>He is the image of the invisble God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&mdash;all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.</p>
