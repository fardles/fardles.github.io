  <section>
  <p>This is a rough-and-not-so-ready compendium of various resources, readings, and reflections surrounding the themes of major liturgical events in the Christian calendar. I take, for my purposes, reference from the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>, specifically the 2019 edition that has been carefully prepared by the Anglican Church in North America. I do not intend to defend every choice made in this edition of the BCP (more than anything else, I do not have much to say), but this is the prayerbook that my family and I use, so that's pretty much that.</p>
  <p>None of this is authoritative in any way, and those interested should consult their own prayerbooks or more helpful sources online (see especially <a href="https://www.lectionarypage.net">The Lectionary Page</a> for an online resource of a much higher caliber).</p>
  <p><em>Pax et bonum</em>
